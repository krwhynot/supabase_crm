# Deployment Configuration Reference

## Vercel Production Deployment

### Configuration Overview
The project uses Vercel for production deployment with optimized configuration for Vue 3 + Vite applications:

```json
{
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### Deployment Settings
- **Framework**: Vite (auto-detected)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` - produces optimized production bundle
- **Output Directory**: `dist/` - contains built static assets
- **Install Command**: `npm ci` - uses package-lock.json for deterministic installs
- **SPA Routing**: All routes redirect to index.html for Vue Router handling

### Environment Variables
Production deployment requires these environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard:

**Required Variables:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key for client connections

**Optional Variables:**
- `VITE_APP_TITLE` - Custom application title
- `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` - Environment identifier (production/staging)

### Production URL
**Live Application**: [crm.kjrcloud.com](https://crm.kjrcloud.com)
- Automatic deployments from main branch
- HTTPS with Vercel SSL certificates
- CDN distribution for global performance

## Build System Configuration

### Vite Production Optimization
The build system includes several performance optimizations:

**Code Splitting:**
- Automatic vendor chunk splitting
- Route-based code splitting for lazy loading
- Dynamic imports for large dependencies

**Asset Optimization:**
- CSS minification and extraction
- Image optimization and compression
- Font subsetting and optimization
- SVG optimization for icons

**Bundle Analysis:**
- Bundle size monitoring
- Dependency analysis
- Performance budget enforcement

### PWA Configuration
Progressive Web App features configured through `vite-plugin-pwa`:

**Service Worker:**
- Offline functionality for core pages
- Background sync for form submissions
- Push notification support (future)

**App Manifest:**
- Native app-like installation
- Custom icon sets for different platforms
- Theme color and display mode configuration

## Testing Configuration

### End-to-End Testing Strategy
Comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright across multiple environments:

**Multi-Browser Testing:**
