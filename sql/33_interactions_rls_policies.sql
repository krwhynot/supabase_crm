-- SECURITY MODEL DOCUMENTATION
-- =============================================================================

/*
INTERACTIONS TABLE SECURITY MODEL

1. PRINCIPAL-BASED ACCESS CONTROL:
   - Interactions inherit security context from related opportunities and contacts
   - Opportunity-linked interactions: Access controlled by opportunity's principal_id
   - Contact-linked interactions: Access controlled by contact's organization (if principal)
   - Orphaned interactions: Allowed for authenticated users (will be enhanced)

2. SECURITY INHERITANCE HIERARCHY:
   Priority: Opportunity Principal > Contact Organization Principal > Direct Access

3. ACCESS CONTROL LEVELS:
   - READ: View interactions for accessible opportunities/contacts
   - INSERT: Create interactions for accessible opportunities/contacts  
   - UPDATE: Modify own interactions or with supervisor access
   - DELETE: Soft delete with ownership or supervisor access

4. EDGE CASE HANDLING:
   - Deleted opportunities: Interactions become inaccessible through opportunity path
   - Deleted contacts: Interactions become inaccessible through contact path
   - Orphaned interactions: Maintained for data integrity, access controlled separately
   - Multi-relationship interactions: Access granted if ANY relationship is accessible

5. DEMO MODE SUPPORT:
   - Anonymous users have full access for demonstration purposes
   - Follows patterns established in contacts and organizations tables
   - Production deployment should disable anonymous policies if needed

6. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
   - User-principal relationship tables for granular access control
   - Role-based access control (viewer, editor, admin, supervisor)
   - Principal-specific user permissions
   - Audit logging to dedicated tables
   - Time-based access controls (business hours, etc.)

7. SECURITY VALIDATION:
   - Referential integrity enforced through triggers
   - Relationship validation on insert/update
   - Security context validation for all operations
   - Audit trail maintenance

8. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Specialized indexes for RLS policy optimization
   - Function-based access control to minimize query complexity
   - Efficient principal context resolution
   - Composite indexes for common access patterns
