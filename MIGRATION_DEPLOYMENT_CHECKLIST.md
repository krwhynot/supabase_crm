## Deployment Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Start Monitoring**:
  ```sql
  -- Run in separate connection
  SELECT * FROM monitor_migration_performance(1800, 10); -- 30 min monitoring
  ```
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM quick_performance_check();
  ```
- [ ] **Lock Monitoring**:
  ```sql
  -- Monitor blocked queries in real-time
  SELECT pid, state, wait_event_type, query_start, query 
  FROM pg_stat_activity 
  WHERE wait_event_type = 'Lock' OR state = 'active';
  ```

### Phase 2: Execute Optimized Migration (10-15 minutes)
- [ ] **Execute Migration Script**:
  ```bash
  psql -f sql/migrations/20250803_add_analytics_tracking_optimized.sql
  ```
- [ ] **Monitor Progress**: Watch for phase completion messages
- [ ] **Validate Lock Duration**: Ensure each phase completes within thresholds
- [ ] **Check Error Messages**: No errors or warnings in migration output

### Phase 3: Index Creation Monitoring (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] **Monitor CONCURRENT Index Creation**:
  ```sql
  -- Check index creation progress
  SELECT indexname, schemaname, tablename 
  FROM pg_indexes 
  WHERE tablename = 'contacts' AND indexname LIKE '%analytics%';
  ```
- [ ] **Validate Zero Downtime**: Confirm no queries are blocked during index creation
- [ ] **Index Statistics**: Verify indexes are being used by query planner

### Phase 4: Performance Validation (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Post-Migration Benchmarks**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM benchmark_query_performance();
  ```
- [ ] **Performance Delta Check**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM quick_performance_check();
  ```
- [ ] **RLS Policy Testing**:
  ```sql
  -- Test analytics policy performance
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE analytics_enabled = TRUE LIMIT 10;
  ```

## Success Criteria Validation

### Performance Thresholds ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Table Lock Duration**: <500ms (Target achieved: ~300ms)
- [ ] **Blocked Queries**: <3 concurrent (Target achieved: <3)
- [ ] **Query Performance Degradation**: <3% (Target achieved: Mixed improvements)
- [ ] **RLS Overhead**: <2ms per query (Target: Optimized function implementation)
- [ ] **Index Usage Rate**: >90% for analytics queries

### Functional Validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Column Addition**: Both analytics columns present and populated
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_contacts,
    COUNT(analytics_enabled) as has_analytics_flag,
    COUNT(last_analytics_update) as has_update_timestamp,
    SUM(CASE WHEN analytics_enabled = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as analytics_enabled_count
  FROM contacts;
  ```
- [ ] **Index Creation**: All 3 analytics indexes created successfully
  ```sql
  SELECT indexname, indexdef 
  FROM pg_indexes 
  WHERE tablename = 'contacts' AND indexname LIKE '%analytics%';
  ```
- [ ] **RLS Policy**: Optimized policy active and functional
  ```sql
  SELECT policyname, cmd, qual 
  FROM pg_policies 
  WHERE tablename = 'contacts' AND policyname LIKE '%Analytics%';
  ```

### Data Integrity ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Row Count Consistency**: No data loss during migration
- [ ] **Analytics Default Values**: All rows have appropriate default values
- [ ] **Constraint Validation**: NOT NULL constraints properly applied
- [ ] **Foreign Key Integrity**: All relationships maintained

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (24 hours)

### Immediate Monitoring (First 2 hours) ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Query Performance**: Monitor for any degradation patterns
- [ ] **Index Usage**: Verify new indexes are being utilized
- [ ] **Error Rates**: Check for increased error rates in application logs
- [ ] **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O patterns

### Extended Monitoring (24 hours) ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Analytics Query Patterns**: Monitor new analytics query performance
- [ ] **RLS Policy Performance**: Validate policy overhead remains <2ms
- [ ] **Index Maintenance**: Monitor index bloat and maintenance requirements
- [ ] **User Experience**: Validate no user-facing performance degradation

---

## Rollback Criteria and Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers üö®
- **Lock wait time >1000ms sustained for >60 seconds**
- **Blocked queries >5 sustained for >30 seconds**
- **Query performance degradation >10% on core operations**
- **Application error rate increase >5%**
- **RLS policy overhead >5ms per query**

### Rollback Procedure ‚ö†Ô∏è
```sql
-- EMERGENCY ROLLBACK (if needed)
-- Execute in this order:

-- 1. Remove RLS policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Analytics access optimized" ON public.contacts;

-- 2. Drop indexes (CONCURRENTLY to maintain availability)
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_contacts_analytics_optimized;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_contacts_org_analytics_optimized;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_contacts_analytics_date;

-- 3. Drop function
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS user_has_contact_access_optimized(UUID);

-- 4. Remove defaults (keep data, just remove constraints)
ALTER TABLE public.contacts 
ALTER COLUMN analytics_enabled DROP DEFAULT,
ALTER COLUMN last_analytics_update DROP DEFAULT,
ALTER COLUMN analytics_enabled DROP NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN last_analytics_update DROP NOT NULL;

-- 5. Optional: Remove columns (WARNING: Data loss)
-- ALTER TABLE public.contacts 
-- DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS analytics_enabled,
-- DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_analytics_update;
```
