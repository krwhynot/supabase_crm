Here is a structured format for designing and implementing a "Create Interaction" Form and Interaction View List Page, aligned with MVP principles, mobile-first priorities, and data integrity requirements.

**MVP SAFETY PROTOCOL INTEGRATION**
This document has been updated to enforce MVP checkpoint safety protocol and reference opportunity component architecture patterns. All interaction form tasks must pass safety checkpoints before proceeding.

üìã Interaction Module Design
Tracks all communication and touchpoints related to advancing Opportunities.

**OPPORTUNITY COMPONENT REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE**
The interaction form system must follow patterns established in the mature opportunity management system:
- Form architecture references: `OpportunityFormWrapper.vue` (3-step wizard), `OpportunityNameField.vue` (auto-naming)
- Validation patterns: Yup schemas with TypeScript inference from `opportunities.ts`
- Accessibility compliance: WCAG 2.1 AA patterns from opportunity components
- Mobile optimization: Responsive patterns from opportunity mobile implementation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Interaction Form ‚Äì Create New Interaction

**SAFETY CHECKPOINT #1: FORM ARCHITECTURE DESIGN**
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Requires approval before implementation
**Requirements**: Component mapping to opportunity analogs must be documented and approved
**Evidence Required**: Architectural review comparing InteractionFormWrapper to OpportunityFormWrapper patterns
**Note**: Form validation must pass QA *and* document sign-off at Checkpoint #2 per MVP protocol

üîç Purpose
To record meaningful interactions (e.g., calls, demos, in-person meetings) that support the progression of existing Opportunities.

**COMPONENT MAPPING TO OPPORTUNITY ANALOGS:**
- `InteractionFormWrapper.vue` ‚Üí follows `OpportunityFormWrapper.vue` 3-step wizard pattern
- `InteractionTypeSelect.vue` ‚Üí follows `StageSelect.vue` validation and accessibility patterns  
- `OpportunitySelect.vue` ‚Üí follows `ProductSelect.vue` filtering and principal-specific logic
- `InteractionNotesField.vue` ‚Üí follows `OpportunityNameField.vue` auto-generation patterns for interaction summaries

üß© Core Concepts
Concept	Description	**Opportunity Reference**
Interaction	A logged event tied to an Opportunity.	Maps to Opportunity relationship pattern
Timing	Created after an Opportunity exists.	Follows opportunity prerequisite validation
Linking	Must be associated with an existing Opportunity (selected via dropdown).	Uses OpportunitySelect component pattern
Follow-ups	Supports scheduling follow-up tasks directly from the interaction.	Extends opportunity workflow progression logic

**SAFETY CHECKPOINT #2: FORM VALIDATION ARCHITECTURE**
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Form validation architecture requires safety validation
**Requirements**: Yup schema must follow opportunity validation patterns with TypeScript inference
**Evidence Required**: Unit tests demonstrating validation compliance + accessibility audit report
**Rollback Procedure**: Revert to opportunity component validation patterns if validation fails
**Note**: All validation rules must be documented and verified before proceeding to implementation

Field	Type	Description	**Opportunity Pattern Reference**
Interaction Type	Dropdown	Email, Call, In-Person, Demo, Follow-up	Follows `StageSelect.vue` enum validation pattern
Date/Time	DateTime Picker	When the interaction took place	Uses opportunity `expected_close_date` validation pattern
Subject	Text Input	Short description of the interaction	Follows `OpportunityNameField.vue` required field pattern
Opportunity	Dropdown (filtered)	Select related Opportunity	Uses `ProductSelect.vue` principal-filtering pattern

üìù Optional Fields

üéØ Mobile-Specific Design Goals
Feature	Description	**Opportunity Mobile Reference**
Quick Templates	Fast-fill interaction types like "Dropped Samples", "Quick Call", etc.	Follows `OpportunityFormWrapper.vue` responsive grid patterns
Voice Input	Supported for notes field	Maps to opportunity notes field accessibility patterns
Touch Optimization	44px minimum touch targets	Uses opportunity component touch target standards

**MOBILE COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:**

2	Choose Interaction Type	Follows `StageSelect.vue` mobile dropdown pattern
3	Add Notes (voice input supported)	Maps to opportunity notes field mobile optimization
4	Link to Opportunity	Uses `ProductSelect.vue` filtered selection pattern

3Ô∏è‚É£ View: Interaction List Page

**SAFETY CHECKPOINT #4: TABLE ARCHITECTURE & ACCESSIBILITY**
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - List view architecture must follow opportunity table patterns
**Requirements**: Component must follow `OpportunityTable.vue` sortable, filterable, accessible table patterns
**Evidence Required**: Accessibility audit report + keyboard navigation testing documentation
**Rollback Procedure**: Revert to `OpportunityTable.vue` component patterns if accessibility tests fail
**Note**: Table implementation requires documented accessibility compliance before proceeding

üìÑ Overview
A dashboard view that lists past interactions in tabular format. Similar in layout and UX to the Opportunity List Page.

**TABLE COMPONENT MAPPING TO OPPORTUNITY ANALOGS:**
- `InteractionTable.vue` ‚Üí follows `OpportunityTable.vue` sortable table pattern
- Column sorting ‚Üí uses opportunity table sort logic with TypeScript type safety
- Filter components ‚Üí follows `OpportunityKPICards.vue` responsive filter pattern
- Search functionality ‚Üí maps to opportunity search implementation with debouncing

const interactionValidationSchema = yup.object({
  interaction_type: yup.string().required('Interaction type is required')
    .oneOf(Object.values(InteractionType), 'Invalid interaction type'), // Follows OpportunityStage pattern
  
  date: yup.date().required('Date is required')
    .max(new Date(), 'Date cannot be in the future'), // Follows opportunity date validation
    
  opportunity_id: yup.string().required('Opportunity is required')
    .uuid('Invalid opportunity ID'), // Follows opportunity organization_id validation
    
  notes: yup.string().max(2000, 'Notes must be less than 2000 characters')
