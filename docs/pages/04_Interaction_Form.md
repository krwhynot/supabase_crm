# Interaction Form - Communication Tracking

## Overview
The Interaction Form logs touchpoints that move deals forward and support opportunity advancement. Interactions are created **after** Opportunities exist to track progression and document activities that advance specific opportunities.

## Purpose
Log touchpoints that move deals forward and support opportunity advancement.

## Structural Model
- **Interaction** logs touchpoints that support or advance existing opportunities
- **Timing**: Created after Opportunity exists to track progression
- **Relationship**: Each interaction can be linked to specific opportunities to show deal advancement

## Form Structure

### Required Fields
- **Type*** - Email, Call, In-Person, Demo/sampled, Quoted price, Follow-up (dropdown)
- **Date/Time*** - When interaction occurred
- **Subject*** - Brief description
- **Opportunity*** - Link to existing opportunity (dropdown) - shows opportunities for this organization

### Auto-Captured Fields (Mobile)
- GPS coordinates (for visit verification)
- Timestamp
- User ID

### Optional Fields
- Duration (minutes)
- Location description
- Detailed notes
- Follow-up required checkbox
- Follow-up date
- Photo attachments (mobile)

## Mobile Optimization

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Quick templates for common interactions**

## Migration Mapping

### Excel to Database Mapping
- Excel "Interactions" â†’ `interactions` table
- Excel "PRIORITY (Formula)" â†’ `priority_formula`
- Excel "NOTES" â†’ `notes`

### Data Quality Rules
- Interaction types mapped to: email, call, in_person, demo, quoted, follow_up
- Date/time stamps required for all interactions
- GPS coordinates optional but recommended for mobile field visits

## Interaction Types

### Communication Types
- **Email** - Email communications with contacts
- **Call** - Phone conversations
- **In-Person** - Face-to-face meetings
- **Demo/Sampled** - Product demonstrations or sampling
- **Quoted Price** - Pricing discussions
- **Follow-up** - Follow-up communications

### GPS Tracking
- **Visit Verification** - GPS coordinates confirm field representative visits
- **Accuracy Tracking** - GPS accuracy in meters for visit verification
- **Location Description** - Text description of visit location

## Business Rules
- Each interaction can be linked to specific opportunities
- GPS coordinates are optional but recommended for mobile field visits
- Follow-up interactions can be scheduled automatically
- Interaction history provides complete touchpoint timeline

## Mobile Field Entry

### Field Representative Workflow
1. **Select Organization** - Quick dropdown search
2. **Choose Interaction Type** - Simplified options for mobile
3. **Auto-Capture Location** - GPS coordinates and timestamp
4. **Voice Notes** - Quick voice-to-text input
5. **Link to Opportunity** - Connect to existing opportunity
6. **Offline Sync** - Data saves locally and syncs when online

### Performance Optimization
- **Quick Entry** - Minimal required fields for speed
- **Auto-Complete** - Predictive text based on history
- **Batch Sync** - Multiple interactions sync together
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handle simultaneous edits gracefully

## Integration Points
- Created after [Opportunity Form](03_Opportunity_Form.md) opportunities are established
- Links to [Contact Form](01_Contact_Form.md) contacts for relationship tracking
- Connects to [Organization Form](02_Organization_Form.md) for organizational context
- Feeds into [Principal Activity Tracking](05_Principal_Activity_Tracking.md) for activity analysis
- Supports [Mobile Optimization](08_Mobile_Optimization.md) workflows
