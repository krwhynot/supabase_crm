## Navigation Patterns

### Sidebar Navigation

The principal navigation is integrated into the main CRM sidebar:

```
CRM Section
├── Organizations
├── Contacts  
├── Opportunities
├── Interactions
└── Principals ← New addition
```

**Active State Highlighting**: The Principals menu item will show as active (highlighted) when on any principal-related route (`/principals*`).

**Mobile Navigation**: On mobile devices (< 768px), the sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu with the same navigation structure.

### Breadcrumb Navigation

Each principal view includes contextual breadcrumbs:

- **List View**: Dashboard > Principals
- **Detail View**: Dashboard > Principals > [Principal Name]
- **Analytics View**: Dashboard > Principals > [Principal Name] > Analytics
- **Products View**: Dashboard > Principals > [Principal Name] > Products
- **Distributors View**: Dashboard > Principals > [Principal Name] > Distributors

### Tab Navigation (Sub-Views)

Within individual principal pages, sub-views are accessible via tab navigation:

```
Principal Detail View
├── Overview (Default)
├── Analytics
├── Products
└── Distributors
```

## Deep Linking and Bookmarking

### URL Structure

The system uses clean, bookmarkable URLs:

```
/principals                           # List all principals
/principals/[uuid]                    # Principal detail dashboard
/principals/[uuid]/analytics          # Analytics view
/principals/[uuid]/products           # Products view  
/principals/[uuid]/distributors       # Distributors view
```

### Query Parameters

Several views support query parameters for filtering and context:

```
/principals?search=acme              # Pre-filter by search term
/principals?status=active            # Filter by activity status
/principals?engagement=high          # Filter by engagement level

/principals/[uuid]?tab=analytics     # Direct to specific tab
/principals/[uuid]?timeframe=90      # Set analytics timeframe
```

### Shareable Links

All principal URLs are shareable and maintain state:

- **Direct Principal Access**: Share `/principals/[uuid]` for immediate access to a specific principal
- **Analytics with Timeframe**: Share `/principals/[uuid]/analytics?timeframe=365` for specific analytics view
- **Filtered Lists**: Share `/principals?search=term&status=active` for pre-filtered results

## Route Guards and Authentication

### Access Control

The system respects existing CRM authentication patterns:

- **Login Required**: All principal routes require authenticated users
- **Permission Checks**: Future implementation will check user permissions for principal access
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles may see different features or data

### Error Handling

The router handles common navigation errors gracefully:

- **Invalid Principal ID**: Redirects to principals list with error message
- **Missing Principal**: Shows "Principal not found" state with navigation back to list
- **Network Errors**: Displays retry options and fallback navigation

## Browser Navigation Support

### Back/Forward Buttons

The system fully supports browser back/forward navigation:

- **History Management**: Each route change updates browser history
- **State Preservation**: Component state is maintained during navigation
- **Scroll Position**: Page scroll position is restored when navigating back

### Keyboard Navigation

Complete keyboard navigation support:

- **Tab Navigation**: Tab through all interactive elements
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between list items and tabs
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close modals and cancel actions

## Integration with Existing CRM Workflows

### Contact Management Integration

Navigate from contact detail pages to related principal information:

```
Contact Detail → Organization → Principal (if organization is a principal)
```

- **Quick Access**: "View Principal" button on organization cards
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains contact context when viewing principal data

### Opportunity Management Integration

Access principal context from opportunity workflows:

```
Opportunity Detail → Principal Detail (via principal link)
Opportunity Creation → Pre-select principal (via query parameter)
```

- **Bidirectional Navigation**: Easy movement between opportunities and principals
- **Contextual Creation**: Create opportunities with principal context preserved

### Interaction System Integration

Navigate between interactions and principal tracking:

```
Interaction Detail → Related Principal (via opportunity connection)
Principal Timeline → Individual Interaction Details
```

- **Timeline Integration**: Principal timeline shows all related interactions
- **Quick Actions**: Log new interactions directly from principal views

## Mobile Navigation Optimizations

### Touch-Friendly Interface

- **44px Minimum Touch Targets**: All navigation elements meet accessibility standards
- **Swipe Gestures**: Support for swipe navigation between tabs (future enhancement)
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh data with pull gesture on mobile devices

### Responsive Breakpoints

Navigation adapts at key breakpoints:

- **< 768px (Mobile)**: Sidebar collapses, tabs become dropdown menu
- **768px - 1024px (Tablet)**: Optimized for iPad viewport with full navigation
- **> 1024px (Desktop)**: Full sidebar and tab navigation

### Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

- **Offline Navigation**: Cached navigation state for offline use
- **App-like Experience**: Smooth transitions and native-feeling navigation
- **Deep Link Support**: URLs work when app is installed as PWA

## Search and Filtering Navigation

### Quick Search

From any view, use the global search to quickly find principals:

- **Global Search Bar**: Available in header (future enhancement)
- **Search Results**: Direct links to principal detail pages
- **Search History**: Recent searches for quick re-access

### Filter Navigation

Navigate filtered views with preserved state:

```
/principals?filter=active        # Show only active principals
/principals?engagement=high      # Show high-engagement principals
/principals?products=>5         # Show principals with 5+ products
```

- **Filter Persistence**: Filters maintained during navigation
- **Clear Filters**: Easy reset to show all principals
- **Filter Combinations**: Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously

## Performance Optimization

### Route-Level Code Splitting

Each principal view is loaded on-demand:

```javascript
component: () => import('@/views/principals/PrincipalsListView.vue')
```

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when accessed
- **Bundle Optimization**: Smaller initial bundle size
- **Caching**: Components cached after first load

### Prefetching Strategies

- **Route Prefetching**: Next likely routes are prefetched on hover
- **Data Prefetching**: Related data loaded in background
- **Image Preloading**: Principal avatars and charts preloaded

## Accessibility Features
