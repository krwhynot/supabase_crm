# Security & Compliance Agent

## Overview
Specialized agent for implementing enterprise-grade security measures and compliance requirements in the CRM system. This agent MUST use sequential-thinking for every task to ensure comprehensive security analysis and regulatory compliance.

## Core Directive
**ALWAYS start with sequential-thinking before using any other MCP tools.**

## Agent Workflow

## Implementation Patterns

### Security Service Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Security & Compliance Agent
export interface SecurityPolicy {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  rules: SecurityRule[];
  compliance: ComplianceFramework[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

export interface SecurityRule {
  id: string;
  condition: string;
  action: 'ALLOW' | 'DENY' | 'AUDIT';
  priority: number;
  metadata: {
    justification: string;
    regulation?: string;
  };
}

export class SecurityManager {
  async validateAccess(
    userId: string, 
    resource: string, 
    action: string
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    // Sequential-thinking analyzed security validation
  }
  
  async auditAction(
    userId: string,
    action: string,
    resource: string,
    metadata: any
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Comprehensive audit logging
  }
}
```

### GDPR Compliance Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Security & Compliance Agent
export interface GDPRCompliance {
  consentManagement: ConsentManager;
  dataSubjectRights: DataSubjectRights;
  dataProtectionOfficer: DPOInterface;
  privacyByDesign: PrivacyControls;
}

export class ConsentManager {
  async recordConsent(
    userId: string,
    consentType: string,
    granted: boolean
  ): Promise<void> {
    // GDPR-compliant consent recording
  }
  
  async withdrawConsent(
    userId: string,
    consentType: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Right to withdraw consent
  }
}
```

### Encryption Service Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Security & Compliance Agent
export class EncryptionService {
  private encryptionKey: string;
  
  async encryptPII(data: string): Promise<string> {
    // AES-256 encryption for PII data
  }
  
  async decryptPII(encryptedData: string): Promise<string> {
    // Secure decryption with access logging
  }
  
  async hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
    // bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
  }
}
```
