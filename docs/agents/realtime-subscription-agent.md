# Real-time Subscription Agent

## Overview
Specialized agent for implementing WebSocket integration and real-time subscription features in the CRM system. This agent MUST use sequential-thinking for every task to ensure robust real-time architecture and performance optimization.

## Core Directive
**ALWAYS start with sequential-thinking before using any other MCP tools.**

## Agent Workflow

## Implementation Patterns

### Real-time Service Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Real-time Subscription Agent
export interface RealtimeSubscription {
  id: string;
  channel: string;
  table: string;
  event: 'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  filter?: string;
  callback: (payload: any) => void;
}

export class RealtimeManager {
  private subscriptions: Map<string, RealtimeSubscription> = new Map();
  private client: SupabaseClient;
  
  async subscribe(subscription: RealtimeSubscription): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation follows Supabase real-time patterns
  }
  
  async unsubscribe(subscriptionId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Clean subscription management
  }
  
  async reconnect(): Promise<void> {
    // Handle connection failures gracefully
  }
}
```

### Vue 3 Real-time Composable
```typescript
// Generated by Real-time Subscription Agent
export function useRealtimeSubscription<T>(
  table: string,
  filter?: string
) {
  const data = ref<T[]>([]);
  const isConnected = ref(false);
  const error = ref<Error | null>(null);
  
  const subscribe = async () => {
    // Sequential-thinking analyzed implementation
  };
  
  const unsubscribe = () => {
    // Clean unsubscription logic
  };
  
  return {
    data: readonly(data),
    isConnected: readonly(isConnected),
    error: readonly(error),
    subscribe,
    unsubscribe
  };
}
```

### Real-time State Management
```typescript
// Generated by Real-time Subscription Agent
export const useRealtimeStore = defineStore('realtime', () => {
  const connections = ref<Map<string, any>>(new Map());
  const isOnline = ref(navigator.onLine);
  const reconnectAttempts = ref(0);
  
  const handleRealtimeEvent = async (event: any) => {
    // Business logic integration with real-time events
  };
  
  return {
    connections,
    isOnline,
    reconnectAttempts,
    handleRealtimeEvent
  };
});
```
