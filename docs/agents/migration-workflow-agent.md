# Migration & Workflow Automation Agent

## Overview
Specialized agent for automating migration processes and workflow orchestration in the CRM system. This agent MUST use sequential-thinking for every task to ensure systematic migration planning and reliable workflow automation.

## Core Directive
**ALWAYS start with sequential-thinking before using any other MCP tools.**

## Implementation Patterns

### Migration Manager Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Migration & Workflow Automation Agent
export interface MigrationStep {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  execute: () => Promise<void>;
  rollback: () => Promise<void>;
  validate: () => Promise<boolean>;
  dependencies: string[];
}

export class MigrationManager {
  private steps: MigrationStep[] = [];
  
  async executeMigration(): Promise<void> {
    // Sequential-thinking analyzed migration execution
  }
  
  async rollbackMigration(): Promise<void> {
    // Safe rollback with dependency checking
  }
  
  async validateMigration(): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Comprehensive migration validation
  }
}
```

### Workflow Engine Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Migration & Workflow Automation Agent
export interface WorkflowDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  triggers: WorkflowTrigger[];
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  conditions: WorkflowCondition[];
  metadata: WorkflowMetadata;
}

export class WorkflowEngine {
  async executeWorkflow(
    workflowId: string,
    context: any
  ): Promise<WorkflowResult> {
    // Event-driven workflow execution
  }
  
  async scheduleWorkflow(
    workflowId: string,
    schedule: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Cron-based workflow scheduling
  }
}
```

### Data Pipeline Pattern
```typescript
// Generated by Migration & Workflow Automation Agent
export interface DataPipeline {
  source: DataSource;
  transformations: DataTransformation[];
  destination: DataDestination;
  validation: ValidationRules;
}

export class DataPipelineManager {
  async executePipeline(
    pipeline: DataPipeline
  ): Promise<PipelineResult> {
    // ETL pipeline execution with error handling
  }
  
  async monitorPipeline(
    pipelineId: string
  ): Promise<PipelineMetrics> {
    // Real-time pipeline monitoring
  }
}
```
