# ADR-006: MCP Ecosystem Integration for AI-Assisted Development

## Status
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Date**: 2025-01-08
- **Deciders**: Development Team, Tech Lead
- **Consulted**: AI Tools Team, Development Workflow Team
- **Informed**: All Developers

## Context

We needed to integrate AI-assisted development tools to enhance developer productivity and code quality. The requirements included:

- **Persistent Memory**: AI context that persists across development sessions
- **Enhanced Research**: Advanced web search and documentation lookup capabilities
- **Code Collaboration**: Improved code review and repository management
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and validation tools
- **Development Workflow**: Seamless integration with existing development tools
- **Local Control**: Tools that work locally without sending sensitive code to external services

The alternatives considered were:
1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Ecosystem**: Local AI tools with persistent context
2. **GitHub Copilot**: Cloud-based AI pair programming
3. **Codeium**: Free AI coding assistant
4. **Custom AI Integration**: Building custom AI tools
5. **No AI Integration**: Traditional development without AI assistance

## Decision

We will integrate the **MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem** to provide AI-assisted development capabilities through local tools that enhance our development workflow.

**Core MCP Servers:**
- **Knowledge Graph**: Persistent AI memory across sessions
- **Exa Search**: Advanced web search and research capabilities
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository management and code collaboration
- **Playwright**: Automated testing and browser automation

## Rationale

### MCP Ecosystem Advantages
- **Local Control**: All processing happens locally, protecting sensitive code
- **Persistent Context**: AI memory that survives between development sessions
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture allowing selective tool integration
- **Open Source**: Community-driven tools with transparent functionality
- **Privacy**: No code sent to external AI services without explicit consent

### Knowledge Graph Benefits
- **Session Continuity**: AI remembers previous conversations and decisions
- **Context Retention**: Builds understanding of codebase over time
- **Learning**: Accumulates knowledge about project patterns and conventions
- **Cross-Session**: Maintains context between different development sessions

### Enhanced Research Capabilities
- **Web Search**: Advanced search for documentation and solutions
- **Company Research**: Enhanced understanding of business context
- **Academic Papers**: Access to research and best practices
- **Documentation Lookup**: Quick access to framework and library docs

### Code Collaboration Features
- **Repository Analysis**: Deep understanding of codebase structure
- **Pull Request Management**: Enhanced code review capabilities
- **Issue Tracking**: Intelligent issue analysis and resolution suggestions
- **Automated Workflows**: Integration with GitHub Actions and workflows

### Quality Assurance Tools
- **Automated Testing**: Intelligent test generation and validation
- **Browser Automation**: End-to-end testing with Playwright
- **UI Validation**: Visual regression testing and accessibility checks
- **Performance Testing**: Automated performance analysis

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Enhanced Productivity**: AI-assisted coding and problem-solving
- **Better Code Quality**: Intelligent suggestions and automated testing
- **Persistent Learning**: AI that improves understanding over time
- **Privacy Protection**: Local processing protects sensitive code
- **Research Efficiency**: Faster access to documentation and solutions
- **Testing Automation**: Reduced manual testing effort

### Negative
- **Setup Complexity**: Additional configuration and tool management
- **Resource Usage**: Local AI processing requires computational resources
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn MCP tool capabilities
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping MCP servers updated and configured

### Risks
- **Low Risk**: Tool stability and reliability
  - **Mitigation**: Use stable MCP server versions and monitor for issues
- **Medium Risk**: Over-reliance on AI tools
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain balance between AI assistance and developer skills
- **Low Risk**: Performance impact on development machines
  - **Mitigation**: Monitor resource usage and optimize configurations

## Implementation

### MCP Configuration File
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "knowledge-graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anysphere/mcp-knowledge-graph"],
      "description": "Persistent AI memory and context management"
    },
    "exa": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-exa"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      },
      "description": "Advanced web search and research capabilities"
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token"
      },
      "description": "Repository management and code collaboration"
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright"],
      "description": "Automated testing and browser automation"
    }
  }
}
```

### Knowledge Graph Integration
```typescript
// Example of AI context retention
interface KnowledgeGraphEntry {
  entityType: 'architecture_decision' | 'code_pattern' | 'bug_fix'
  relationships: string[]
  observations: string[]
  createdAt: Date
}

// AI remembers architectural decisions
const architecturalKnowledge = {
  vue3_patterns: [
    'Use Composition API for all new components',
    'Implement reactive forms with Yup validation',
    'Pinia stores for cross-component state management'
  ],
  testing_patterns: [
    'Playwright for E2E testing',
    'Vitest for unit testing',
    'Test component behavior, not implementation'
  ]
}
```

### Development Workflow Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions with MCP integration
