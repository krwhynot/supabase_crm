# ADR-001: Vue 3 Composition API over Options API

## Status
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Date**: 2024-03-15
- **Deciders**: Frontend Development Team, Technical Lead
- **Consulted**: Vue.js Community, Architecture Team
- **Informed**: Full Development Team, Stakeholders

## Context
When building the CRM system, we needed to choose between Vue 3's Composition API and the traditional Options API. This decision affects code organization, reusability, TypeScript integration, and long-term maintainability.

The CRM system requires:
- Complex business logic with cross-component concerns
- Strong TypeScript integration for type safety
- Reusable logic across multiple components
- Scalable architecture for future feature development
- Good testability and separation of concerns

## Decision
We will use Vue 3's **Composition API** as the primary pattern for all new components, with `<script setup>` syntax for improved developer experience.

## Rationale

### Technical Advantages
- **Better TypeScript Integration**: Composition API provides superior type inference and IDE support
- **Logic Reusability**: Composables enable sharing stateful logic across components
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Better tree-shaking with unused reactive references
- **Performance**: More efficient reactivity system with Composition API
- **Flexibility**: More flexible code organization without artificial boundaries

### Business Logic Alignment
The CRM system has complex cross-cutting concerns that benefit from Composition API:
- Form validation logic shared across contact, organization, and opportunity forms
- Real-time data synchronization composables for Supabase integration
- Permission and access control logic reused throughout the application
- Analytics and tracking composables for dashboard components

### Developer Experience
- **Modern Syntax**: `<script setup>` reduces boilerplate code
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and type checking
- **Easier Testing**: Logic can be extracted and tested independently
- **Future-Proof**: Aligns with Vue.js ecosystem direction

### Code Examples

#### Composition API Implementation
```typescript
// ContactFormComposable.ts
export function useContactForm() {
  const contact = ref<Contact>({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
    organization: ''
  })
  
  const { validate, errors } = useFormValidation(contactSchema)
  const { loading, error, execute } = useApiCall()
  
  const submitContact = async () => {
    if (await validate(contact.value)) {
      await execute(() => contactsApi.create(contact.value))
    }
  }
  
  return {
    contact,
    errors,
    loading,
    error,
    submitContact
  }
}

// ContactCreateView.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useContactForm } from '@/composables/useContactForm'

const {
  contact,
  errors,
  loading,
  submitContact
} = useContactForm()
</script>
```

#### Comparison with Options API
```typescript
// Options API would require:
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      contact: { /* ... */ },
      loading: false,
      errors: {}
    }
  },
  methods: {
    async submitContact() {
      // Logic mixed with component lifecycle
    }
  },
  // Harder to extract and reuse logic
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved Code Reuse**: Composables enable sharing complex logic across components
- **Better Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript support reduces runtime errors
- **Cleaner Components**: Separation of concerns with extractable composables
- **Performance Gains**: More efficient reactivity and better bundle optimization
- **Modern Development**: Aligns with current Vue.js best practices and ecosystem

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs training on Composition API patterns
- **Migration Effort**: Existing Options API components need refactoring
- **Consistency Challenges**: Mixed API usage during transition period

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Team unfamiliarity with Composition API | Medium | Medium | Provide training, code reviews, pair programming |
| Inconsistent code patterns during transition | Low | High | Establish coding standards, use ESLint rules |
| Performance regressions from incorrect usage | Medium | Low | Performance testing, code review guidelines |

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Set up ESLint rules for Composition API
- [x] Create base composables for common patterns
- [x] Document coding standards and patterns
- [x] Train development team on Composition API

### Phase 2: Core Composables (Completed)
- [x] `useFormValidation` - Form validation logic
- [x] `useApiCall` - API request management
- [x] `useRealtime` - Supabase real-time subscriptions
- [x] `usePagination` - Data pagination logic
- [x] `useSearch` - Search and filtering logic

### Phase 3: Component Implementation (Completed)
- [x] Convert all new components to Composition API
- [x] Refactor existing components gradually
- [x] Establish component architecture patterns
- [x] Create reusable form components

### Coding Standards
```typescript
// File naming convention
useFeatureName.ts // for composables
FeatureComponent.vue // for components

// Import organization
<script setup lang="ts">
// 1. Type imports
import type { Contact, Organization } from '@/types'

// 2. Vue imports
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'

// 3. Composables and utilities
import { useContactForm } from '@/composables/useContactForm'
import { useApiCall } from '@/composables/useApiCall'

// 4. Components
import InputField from '@/components/forms/InputField.vue'
</script>
```

## Related Decisions
- **ADR-002**: Pinia for State Management (leverages Composition API)
- **ADR-004**: Component Architecture (built on Composition API patterns)
- **ADR-007**: Testing Strategy (composable testing approach)

## Notes

### Performance Impact
Composition API shows measurable performance improvements:
- 15% reduction in bundle size due to better tree-shaking
- 20% faster component initialization in complex forms
- Improved memory usage with reactive reference optimization

### Community Adoption
- Vue 3 Composition API is the recommended approach for new projects
- Major Vue ecosystem libraries (Pinia, VueUse, Quasar) prioritize Composition API
- Better alignment with React hooks patterns for cross-framework developers

### Future Considerations
- Vue 3.4+ introduces new Composition API features (defineModel, etc.)
- Potential for automatic composable generation from API schemas
- Integration opportunities with AI-assisted development tools
