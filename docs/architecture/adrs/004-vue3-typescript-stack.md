# ADR-004: Vue 3 + TypeScript Technology Stack Selection

## Status
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Date**: 2025-01-08
- **Deciders**: Development Team, Tech Lead
- **Consulted**: Frontend Team, Architecture Team
- **Informed**: All Stakeholders

## Context

We needed to select a modern frontend technology stack for building a comprehensive CRM system with the following requirements:

- **User Experience**: Responsive, accessible interface supporting sales users, administrators, and executives
- **Development Velocity**: Fast development cycles with good developer experience
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing to reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability
- **Modern Standards**: ES2020+ support with modern JavaScript features
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of libraries and tooling
- **Performance**: Fast initial load times and smooth user interactions
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle complex business logic and growing feature set

The alternatives considered were:
1. **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Progressive framework with Composition API
2. **React + TypeScript**: Popular ecosystem with extensive community
3. **Angular**: Full framework with built-in TypeScript support
4. **Svelte + TypeScript**: Compile-time framework with smaller bundles

## Decision

We will use **Vue 3 with TypeScript and the Composition API** as our primary frontend technology stack.

**Core Stack Components:**
- **Vue 3.4+**: Progressive JavaScript framework with Composition API
- **TypeScript 5.3+**: Static type checking and enhanced IDE support
- **Vite 5.0+**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Vue Router 4**: Client-side routing with nested routes
- **Composition API**: Modern reactive programming model

## Rationale

### Vue 3 Advantages
- **Progressive Adoption**: Can be incrementally adopted and integrated
- **Performance**: Optimized virtual DOM with proxy-based reactivity
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent Vue DevTools and IDE integration
- **Learning Curve**: Gentler learning curve compared to React or Angular
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller bundle size with tree-shaking support

### TypeScript Integration
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection and IDE autocomplete
- **Refactoring**: Safe refactoring across large codebases
- **API Integration**: Strong typing for Supabase API responses
- **Team Productivity**: Better code documentation and fewer bugs

### Composition API Benefits
- **Reusability**: Better logic composition and sharing between components
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript inference and support
- **Flexibility**: More flexible than Options API for complex components
- **Performance**: Better tree-shaking and bundle optimization

### Vite Advantages
- **Fast Development**: Near-instantaneous hot module replacement
- **Modern Bundling**: Native ES modules in development
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich plugin ecosystem for Vue and TypeScript
- **Production Optimization**: Rollup-based optimized production builds

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid Development**: Fast iteration cycles with excellent DX
- **Type Safety**: Reduced runtime errors and improved code quality
- **Modern Patterns**: Clean, maintainable code with Composition API
- **Performance**: Fast application startup and smooth interactions
- **Ecosystem**: Access to Vue 3 ecosystem and TypeScript tooling
- **Future-Proof**: Modern stack aligned with current best practices

### Negative
- **Learning Investment**: Team needs to learn Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- **TypeScript Complexity**: Additional complexity for type definitions
- **Build Configuration**: More complex build setup compared to simple HTML/JS
- **Dependency Management**: Need to manage NPM dependencies and updates

### Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Vue 3 ecosystem maturity compared to React
  - **Mitigation**: Vue 3 is production-ready with strong community support
- **Low Risk**: TypeScript configuration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Use community-proven configurations and tooling

## Implementation

### Technology Versions
- Vue 3.4+ for latest Composition API features
- TypeScript 5.3+ for modern type system features
- Vite 5.0+ for optimal development experience
- Vue Router 4.x for routing capabilities

### Project Structure

```

### Development Standards
- Use `<script setup>` syntax for component definitions
- Strict TypeScript configuration with no implicit any
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting and quality
- Component composition over inheritance patterns

### Build Configuration
- Vite for development server and production builds
- TypeScript path mapping for clean imports
- Code splitting for optimal bundle sizes
- Environment-based configuration management
