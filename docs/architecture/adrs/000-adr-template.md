# ADR-000: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
- **Status**: Template
- **Date**: 2025-01-08
- **Deciders**: Development Team
- **Consulted**: Architecture Team
- **Informed**: Stakeholders

## Context
This template provides the standard format for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the CRM system. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## Decision
We will use this template for all architecture decision records to ensure consistency and completeness in our documentation.

## Rationale
- **Consistency**: Standardized format for all architectural decisions
- **Completeness**: Ensures all important aspects are considered
- **Traceability**: Clear tracking of decision evolution over time
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Helps new team members understand architectural choices

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Consistent format across all ADRs
- Better knowledge retention and transfer
- Improved decision-making process

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain
- May slow down decision implementation

### Risks
- **Low Risk**: Documentation may become outdated if not maintained
- **Mitigation**: Regular ADR reviews during architecture discussions

## Implementation
1. Copy this template for each new ADR
2. Number ADRs sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
3. Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate the decision
4. Update status as decisions evolve

## Related Decisions
- None (this is the template)

## Notes
- ADRs are immutable once finalized
- Use superseding ADRs for major changes
- Include diagrams and code examples when helpful
