### For Architects
1. Review all [Architecture Decision Records](./adrs/) for decision history
2. Study [Security Architecture](./security/) for security posture
3. Analyze [Quality Attributes](./quality/) for non-functional requirements

### For DevOps/Platform Engineers
1. Focus on [Deployment Architecture](./deployment/) for infrastructure
2. Review [Data Architecture](./data/) for database management
3. Study [Monitoring](./deployment/04-monitoring.md) for operational concerns

## ü§ù Contributing to Architecture
