---

## Accessibility (A11y)

### ARIA Guidelines

**Required implementation:**

- ARIA expanded/collapsed states for toggles
- Descriptive ARIA labels for form controls

### Keyboard Navigation

**Mandatory requirements:**

- Lists for grouped content (ul, ol, dl)
- Form labels properly associated with inputs

### Screen Reader Support

- Meaningful alt text for images

---

## Performance

### Asset Optimization

**Required optimizations:**
- Images: WebP format with fallbacks, proper sizing
- Fonts: Preload critical fonts, font-display: swap
- Icons: Use SVG sprites or icon fonts
- CSS: Minimize and compress, remove unused styles

### Loading Performance

**Benchmarks:**
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5 seconds
- First Input Delay: <100 milliseconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1

### Optimization Strategies

- Lazy load non-critical images and content
- Minimize render-blocking resources
- Use efficient CSS selectors and avoid deep nesting
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Bundle splitting for code optimization

### Performance Monitoring

**Required:** Regular performance audits using:
- Lighthouse for Core Web Vitals
- WebPageTest for detailed analysis
- Real user monitoring in production
- Performance budgets for build processes

## UI Design Laws & Principles

### Core Design Psychology Laws

These fundamental UI design laws must be applied throughout all interface development to ensure optimal user experience and behavior.

**Jakob's Law** - Users expect familiar patterns from other applications
- Place search functionality in top-right corner consistently
- Position primary navigation in left sidebar following standard CRM conventions
- Use established icon conventions (hamburger menu, magnifying glass for search)

**Hick's Law** - More choices increase decision time exponentially
- Limit main navigation menu to 5-7 items maximum
- Hide advanced options under "More" or secondary menus
- Group related actions to reduce cognitive load

**Fitts's Law** - Larger, closer targets are easier and faster to hit
- Make primary action buttons larger and more prominent (48px minimum)
- Position frequently used actions closer to user's natural interaction zones
- Increase button size for touch interfaces (44px minimum)

**Aesthetic-Usability Effect** - Beautiful interfaces feel more usable and forgiving
- Use high-quality imagery and consistent visual branding
- Maintain clean, uncluttered layouts with proper white space
- Apply consistent color schemes and typography throughout

**Law of Proximity** - Related elements should be grouped together visually
- Group related form fields and information together
- Keep actions close to the content they affect
- Use consistent spacing to show relationships between elements

**Progressive Disclosure** - Show only what's needed now, reveal more on demand
- Display primary information first, allow expansion for details
- Use progressive forms that reveal fields as needed
- Implement collapsible sections for complex interfaces

**Miller's Law** - People can hold 7Â±2 items in short-term memory
- Limit dashboard widgets to 5-7 key metrics
- Break long lists into chunked sections
- Use pagination or infinite scroll for extensive data sets

**Doherty Threshold** - System response under 400ms feels instant
- Show loading placeholders for any action taking >200ms
- Provide progress indicators for operations >1 second
- Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate

**Law of Similarity** - Similar-looking elements feel functionally related
- Use consistent styling for all buttons of the same type
- Apply uniform icon styles throughout the interface
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment patterns

**Zeigarnik Effect** - People remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones
- Show progress indicators: "3 of 5 required fields completed"
- Highlight missing information in forms and workflows
- Use visual cues to indicate incomplete processes

### Behavioral Design Principles

**Goal-Gradient Effect** - Motivation increases as users approach goal completion
- Display progress toward completion: "2 more items needed for free shipping"
- Show advancement through multi-step processes
- Highlight proximity to achieving objectives

**Von Restorff Effect** - Different items stand out and are remembered better
- Highlight special offers, alerts, or important actions with distinct styling
- Use color contrast to emphasize critical information
- Make primary actions visually distinct from secondary ones

**Tesler's Law** - Complexity cannot be eliminated, only moved around
- Auto-fill known information to simplify user input
- Move complexity to the system rather than burdening users
- Provide smart defaults while allowing customization

**Peak-End Rule** - Experiences are judged by peak moment and ending
- Ensure confirmation pages and completion states are well-designed
- Make success messages delightful and reassuring
- End user journeys with positive, clear outcomes

**Serial Position Effect** - First and last items in lists are remembered best
- Place most important navigation items first and last
- Position critical information at the beginning or end of content
- Structure forms with essential fields at top and bottom

### Implementation Requirements

**Consistency Principle** - Similar actions should work the same way
- Use identical button styles and placement across all forms
- Maintain consistent interaction patterns throughout the application
- Apply uniform terminology and labeling conventions

**Feedback Principle** - Every user action needs a clear response
- Show "Added to cart" or success messages for all interactions
- Provide visual feedback for hover, focus, and active states
- Use appropriate micro-animations to acknowledge user actions

**Forgiveness Principle** - Make errors easy to recover from
- Provide "Undo" options for destructive actions
- Allow easy correction of form errors without data loss
- Include confirmation dialogs for irreversible actions

### Psychological Influence Patterns

**Anchoring Bias** - First information encountered influences all subsequent decisions
- Show premium options first to establish value perception
- Present pricing in context of higher-value alternatives
- Use reference points to guide user expectations

**Framing Effect** - How information is presented affects decision-making
- Present savings as "Save $X" rather than showing reduced prices
- Frame benefits positively: "90% uptime" vs "10% downtime"
- Use action-oriented language in calls-to-action

**Loss Aversion** - People fear losing more than they value gaining
- Use time-limited offers: "Sale ends in 2 hours"
- Show what users might miss: "Only 3 spots remaining"
- Highlight potential losses from inaction

**Social Proof** - People follow others' behavior and decisions
- Display user counts: "127 people ordered this today"
- Show ratings, reviews, and testimonials prominently
- Indicate popular choices and trending items

**Reciprocity Principle** - People feel obligated to return favors
- Offer valuable content or tools before requesting information
- Provide helpful features or samples to build goodwill
- Frame requests as mutual benefit rather than one-sided asks

**Scarcity Principle** - Limited availability increases perceived value and desire
- Show inventory levels: "Only 3 remaining in stock"
- Use time constraints for special offers or availability
- Highlight exclusive or limited-access features

**Commitment Consistency** - People align future actions with stated commitments
- Ask users to set preferences, then highlight matching content
- Use quiz results to personalize recommendations
- Reference user's previous choices in future interactions

### Application Guidelines

- Apply these laws consistently across all interface elements
- Test implementations against user behavior and expectations
- Document which principles guide specific design decisions
- Review designs regularly to ensure psychological principles are properly applied
