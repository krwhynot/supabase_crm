## ðŸš¨ MVP Safety Protocol

### Critical Success Factors
- [ ] **Complete project backup**: Full git repository backup and working directory snapshot
- [ ] **Environment validation**: Verify all development tools, database connections, and MCP integration
- [ ] **Architectural review**: Confirm understanding of existing Vue 3 + TypeScript + Supabase patterns
- [ ] **Safety protocol acknowledgment**: Team agreement on checkpoint methodology and rollback criteria

### Git Checkpoint Strategy

#### Master Checkpoint Protocol
Execute these commands before starting implementation:

```bash
# Create comprehensive pre-implementation checkpoint
git add .
git status  # Verify all changes are staged
git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: Pre-MVP Organizations UI implementation baseline - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"

# Create feature branch for entire MVP implementation
git checkout -b feature/organizations-ui-mvp
git push -u origin feature/organizations-ui-mvp

# Document the checkpoint SHA for emergency rollback
git log --oneline -1 > MVP_BASELINE_CHECKPOINT.txt
```

#### Multi-Layer Branching Strategy

**Layer 1: Feature Branch**
- `feature/organizations-ui-mvp` - Main integration branch for all MVP development

**Layer 2: Stage Branches**
- `stage/01-pre-development-planning`
- `stage/02-database-implementation`
- `stage/03-type-definitions`
- `stage/04-store-implementation`
- `stage/05-component-implementation`
- `stage/06-route-integration`
- `stage/07-testing-validation`
- `stage/08-deployment-documentation`

**Layer 3: Task Branches**
Individual branches for each checklist task:
```bash
git checkout stage/[XX-stage-name]
git checkout -b task/[stage-name]-[task-description]
```

### Quality Gates & Validation Framework

#### Mandatory Validation After Every Change
```bash
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run dev  # Check browser console for errors
```

#### Stage Completion Verification
```bash
# Complete validation suite
npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run build

# Performance verification  
npm run preview

# Commit with confidence level
git add .
git commit -m "feat(organizations): Stage X completed - [description] (Confidence: X%)"
```

### Emergency Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- TypeScript compilation errors unresolvable within 30 minutes
- Build failures affecting existing functionality
- Database connectivity issues
- Breaking changes to existing user_submissions functionality
- Performance degradation >50% from baseline

#### Emergency Rollback Commands
```bash
# Return to last known good state
git checkout feature/organizations-ui-mvp
git reset --hard [LAST_KNOWN_GOOD_SHA]

# Or return to baseline
git reset --hard [BASELINE_CHECKPOINT_SHA]
```
