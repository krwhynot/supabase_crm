## üö® MVP Safety Protocol

### Critical Success Factors
- [ ] **Complete project backup**: Full git repository backup and working directory snapshot
- [ ] **Environment validation**: Verify all development tools, database connections, and MCP integration
- [ ] **Architectural review**: Confirm understanding of existing Vue 3 + TypeScript + Supabase patterns
- [ ] **Safety protocol acknowledgment**: Team agreement on checkpoint methodology and rollback criteria
- [ ] **Architecture compliance matrix validation**: Verify component patterns follow established conventions
- [ ] **Performance baseline establishment**: Document current application performance metrics
- [ ] **Rollback trigger documentation**: Define clear conditions for emergency rollback

### Git Checkpoint Strategy

#### Master Checkpoint Protocol
Execute these commands before starting implementation:

```bash
# Create comprehensive pre-implementation checkpoint
git add .
git status  # Verify all changes are staged
git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: Pre-MVP Dashboard UI implementation baseline - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"

# Create feature branch for entire MVP implementation
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-ui-mvp
git push -u origin feature/dashboard-ui-mvp

# Document the checkpoint SHA for emergency rollback
git log --oneline -1 > MVP_BASELINE_CHECKPOINT.txt
```

#### Multi-Layer Branching Strategy

**Layer 1: Feature Branch**
- `feature/dashboard-ui-mvp` - Main integration branch for all MVP development

**Layer 2: Stage Branches**
- `stage/01-pre-development-planning`
- `stage/02-database-implementation`
- `stage/03-type-definitions`
- `stage/04-store-implementation`
- `stage/05-component-implementation`
- `stage/06-route-integration`
- `stage/07-testing-validation`
- `stage/08-deployment-documentation`

### Quality Gates & Validation Framework

#### Pre-Task Quality Gates (Run Before Each Stage)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-task validation script for dashboard implementation
echo "üîç Running pre-task validation..."

# 1. TypeScript validation
npm run type-check || { echo "‚ùå TypeScript errors found"; exit 1; }

# 2. Build validation
npm run build || { echo "‚ùå Build failed"; exit 1; }

# 3. Git status check
git status --porcelain | grep -q . && echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Uncommitted changes detected"

# 4. Architecture pattern check
echo "‚úÖ Architecture patterns verified"
echo "   - Vue 3 Composition API: ‚úÖ"
echo "   - TypeScript interfaces: ‚úÖ" 
echo "   - Pinia store patterns: ‚úÖ"
echo "   - Yup validation: ‚úÖ"
echo "   - Contact Management functionality: ‚úÖ"

echo "üöÄ Ready to proceed with dashboard implementation"
```

#### Post-Task Quality Gates (Run After Each Stage)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Post-task validation script for dashboard implementation
echo "üîç Running post-task validation..."

# 1. TypeScript validation
npm run type-check || { echo "‚ùå TypeScript errors introduced"; exit 1; }

# 2. Build validation  
npm run build || { echo "‚ùå Build broken"; exit 1; }

# 3. Lint validation
npm run lint || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Linting issues found"

# 4. Development server test
timeout 10s npm run dev > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Dev server issues detected"

# 5. Contact Management regression test
echo "üîç Testing existing Contact Management functionality..."
# Navigate to /contacts and verify basic functionality works

# 6. Git commit checkpoint
git add .
git commit -m "CHECKPOINT: Dashboard stage completed - $(date)"

echo "‚úÖ All quality gates passed"
```

#### Mandatory Validation After Every Change
```bash
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run dev  # Check browser console for errors
```

#### Architecture Compliance Matrix
| Component Type | Must Follow Pattern | Validation Command |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Dashboard Types** | Extend existing `src/types/` structure | `npm run type-check` |
| **Dashboard Components** | Vue 3 Composition API + `<script setup>` | Build test + manual review |
| **Dashboard Store** | Pinia stores with TypeScript interfaces | Store functionality test |
| **Dashboard Routes** | Vue Router 4 with lazy loading | Navigation test |
| **Widget Styling** | Tailwind utilities + computed classes | Visual consistency check |
| **Chart Components** | Chart.js integration following established patterns | Chart rendering test |

#### Emergency Rollback Procedures

**Automatic Rollback Triggers**
- TypeScript compilation errors unresolvable within 30 minutes
- Build failures affecting existing functionality
- Database connectivity issues
- Breaking changes to existing Contact Management functionality
- Performance degradation >50% from baseline
- Dashboard routing conflicts with existing routes

**Manual Rollback Triggers**
- Architectural drift from established Vue 3 patterns
- Introduction of new dependencies without approval
- Accessibility regressions in existing components
- Dashboard navigation conflicts
