## Pre-Development Planning

### Feature Requirements Definition
- [ ] **Identify Core User Problem**: Enable users to store, view, and manage a basic list of professional contacts without complexity barriers (Confidence: 95%)

### Technical Planning
- [ ] **Define MVP Feature Boundaries**: Establish clear IN-SCOPE vs OUT-OF-SCOPE feature boundaries with stakeholder agreement (Confidence: 95%)

## Stage 1: Database Implementation

- [ ] **Define MVP Data Model**: Create Contact entity structure with essential fields only (id, firstName, lastName, organization, email) (Confidence: 95%)
- [ ] **Extend Database Schema**: Create contacts table building on existing Supabase patterns with essential fields (Confidence: 90%)

## Stage 2: Type Definitions & Interfaces

- [ ] **Create Feature-Specific Types**: Generate TypeScript types and validation schemas for the Contact entity and related forms (Confidence: 90%)

## Stage 3: Store Implementation (State Management)

- [ ] **Design State Management Architecture**: Create ContactStore with CRUD operations and search functionality using existing Pinia patterns (Confidence: 90%)

## Stage 4: Component Implementation

- [ ] **Implement Essential Design Tokens**: Set up core color palette, typography system, spacing system, and border radius for MVP components (Confidence: 90%)
- [ ] **Build Atomic Components**: Develop Button, Input, Avatar, and LoadingSpinner components with consistent styling (Confidence: 90%)
- [ ] **Build Molecular Components**: Create FormField, SearchBar, and Pagination components for contact management (Confidence: 90%)
- [ ] **Build Organism Components**: Implement DataTable for contact display and ContactForm for create/edit operations (Confidence: 90%)
- [ ] **Implement ContactsListView**: Build main landing page with sortable table, search bar, and "New Contact" action (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Implement ContactCreateView**: Create streamlined form for new contact creation with essential fields only (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Implement ContactEditView**: Build contact modification interface reusing ContactForm component (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Implement ContactDetailView**: Create basic single-panel view for contact information display (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Implement Basic Search**: Add single-field search functionality filtering contacts by name (Confidence: 85%)

## Stage 5: Route Integration

- [ ] **Establish Navigation Architecture**: Set up routing structure (/contacts, /contacts/new, /contacts/:id, /contacts/:id/edit) (Confidence: 85%)

## Stage 6: Testing & Validation

- [ ] **Create Database Integration**: Implement basic CRUD operations extending existing Supabase client patterns (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Implement Unit Testing**: Test contact form validation, search filtering, and state management actions (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Implement Integration Testing**: Test contact creation flow, editing flow, and search functionality (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Create Manual E2E Test Script**: Define single critical path test covering create → list → search → view → edit workflow (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **Establish Performance Baseline**: Test contact list rendering with 100+ contacts and search response times (Confidence: 85%)
- [ ] **UI Polish and Validation**: Ensure consistent styling with design system and basic functionality validation (Confidence: 85%)

## Future Tasks (Post-MVP)

- [ ] **Advanced Search**: Implement multi-field filtering capabilities with advanced search interface
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Add multi-select interface with bulk edit, export, and delete functionality  
- [ ] **Grid View Mode**: Implement card-based display option alongside existing table view
- [ ] **ContactMasterDetail Interface**: Build split-view interface for power users with contact browsing and editing
- [ ] **Tabbed Content Organization**: Add tabbed sections in detail view (Interactions, Organization, etc.)
- [ ] **Complex Field Support**: Implement priority, preferredContactMethod, and other advanced contact fields
- [ ] **Import/Export Functionality**: Build contact import wizard with CSV/Excel support and export options
- [ ] **Advanced Relationship Mapping**: Implement complex organization and opportunity linking interfaces
- [ ] **Accessibility Testing**: Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing and optimization
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading, virtualization, and advanced caching strategies
