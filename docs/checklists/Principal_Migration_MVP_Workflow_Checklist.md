# Principal-Centric CRM Migration MVP Implementation Checklist

## Executive Summary
**Business Value:** Transform basic CRM to relationship-focused, principal-centric system that eliminates financial metrics and focuses on building meaningful relationships with potential buyers through multi-principal opportunity management.

**Implementation Timeline:** 14-16 business days (2.8-3.2 weeks)

**Risk Level:** Medium - Complex database migration with zero data loss requirement, extensive type system changes, and architectural transformation across all application layers.

**Architecture Impact:** Major transformation of core data model from basic CRM to principal-centric system with relationship focus. Affects database schema, type definitions, stores, components, and routing layers. Maintains Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Supabase stack integrity.
